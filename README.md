# Liquid

Pluggable proxy obfuscation designed as a countermeasure to advanced fingerprinting and packet inspection techniques used by
firewalls.

This implementation was inspired by [Cloak](https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak.git). For more information, read the [steganography and encryption](https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak/wiki/Steganography-and-encryption) guide on Cloak's wiki.

## Installation

by adding `liquid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [

  ]
end
```
